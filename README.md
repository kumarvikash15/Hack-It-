# Hack-It-
We will be demonstrating a sample access control over a server through a planted remote device e.g. Raspberry Pi. That device will perform exploitation and post exploitation tasks within the network by compromising the live hosts available in that network. We just place the malicious device in the premises so that it can capture the wifi signal of organizations internal network  then we establish a remote connection to the device and will scan the network from that implanted device, for demonstration purpose we scan a vulnerable system so that it can be easily exploited so that we will take control over the server. Also Created a Web App through which each action can be done easily.
